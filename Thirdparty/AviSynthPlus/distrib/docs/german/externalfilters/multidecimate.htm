<h1>MultiDecimate 1.0.7<br>
(for Avisynth 2.5)</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This filter provides extended decimation capabilities not available from
Decimate(). It can remove all the duplicate frames from a clip, or it can remove
N out of every M frames, where N and M can be selected by the user, removing the
frames most similar to their predecessors. Special modes are available to
protect static scenes from decimation.
<p>This filter uses a 2-pass approach to allow for full timeline random access
navigation, random decimation, and the later addition of a GUI-based manual
tweaking capability.
<p>This filter is valuable when traditional 1-in-5 decimation is not sufficient.
For example, many silent films are transferred to DVD by adding duplicates in
unusual patterns, because the original frame rates are not 24fps. It is not
unusual to see clips requiring strange decimations such as 20 in 43. Sometimes
these strange decimations can be attained, or nearly attained, through repeated
application of Decimate() using different cycles, but that is a cumbersome
approach that cannot always attain the exact decimation ratios required. This
filter tries to approach the problem more directly, but at the expense of 2-pass
operation.
<p>Another typical application is removing 3 out of 4 frames for clips that were
rendered at 120fps to properly present hybrids of film and video.
<p>This version supports YUY2 only for Avisynth 2.5. YV12 will be added when the
functionality stabilizes.

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
Place MultiDecimate.exe and ProcessMD.exe somewhere in your DOS executable path.
Put the MultiDecimate.dll in your Avisynth plugins folder (or load it manually
in your scripts). If you are clueless about DOS paths, just put
MultiDecimate.exe and ProcessMD.exe in your script directory.
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Process</h3>
<b>Step1.</b> Make your script for pass 1:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MultiDecimate(pass=1)
<p>Load the script and play it straight through from the beginning to completion
(do not jump around on the timeline first!). This makes the metrics file, <i>mfile.txt</i>,
in your script directory. If you want to examine your video for duplicate
patterns, comment out the MultiDecimate() call, do not try to do it during pass
1, as any timeline jumps will corrupt the metrics file. Finally, after pass 1
completes, immediately exit VirtualDub; do not scroll around.
<p>It is a waste of time to include any filters after the MultiDecimate() call
in the first pass. Comment them out for faster performance. Comment them back in
for the second pass.
<p><b>Step 2.</b> Execute MultiDecimate.exe to run the GUI. Browse to select the
<i>mfile.txt</i> file. Select the desired mode (see below for a description of
the modes). Set the remaining configuration boxes as required (see below). Then
click on the Create button. This makes the <i>cfile.txt</i> and <i>dfile.txt</i>
files in your script directory.
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Edit the script to change pass=1 to pass=2. Now you can load
the script and it will have the correct decimated video, and timeline random
access navigation will be supported. Pass 2 reads the <i>dfile.txt</i> file into
memory and uses it to determine which frames to deliver.

<h3>GUI Decimation Modes and Configuration</h3>
The following modes are available:
<p>&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Remove duplicates: Global: Naive&quot;: This mode will remove all
    frames determined to be duplicates as defined by the configured Threshold.
    Frames with a metric less than threshold will be considered to be
    duplicates. Examine <i>mfile.txt</i> to examine the frame metrics.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <li>&quot;Remove duplicates: Global: Protect static scenes&quot;: This mode
    will remove all frames determined to be duplicates as defined by the
    threshold configuration, but static scenes will not be removed. A static
    scene is defined to be one with a run of duplicates equal to or greater than
    the configured Run Length.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <li>&quot;Remove duplicates: Cycle-based: Naive&quot;: This mode will remove N
    out of every M frames, where N is defined by the configured Cycle, and M is
    defined by the configured Remove.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <li>&quot;Remove duplicates: Cycle-based: Protect static scenes&quot;: This
    mode will remove N out of every M frames, as above, but static scenes are
    &quot;protected&quot;. In naive mode, a static scene within a cycle may be
    preferentially decimated. This may be bad because you may lose too much of
    the static scene, and because taking extra duplicates from the static scene
    means that extra dups are being left in the action scenes.
    <p>To address this, use the &quot;protect static scenes&quot; mode. When you
    choose this mode from the drop down list, two extra edit boxes appear.
    Threshold is the metric below which duplicates are declared. The metrics are
    the same as those used in the <i>mfile.txt</i> file, so you can use that to
    help you. The fields in <i>mfile.txt</i> are as follows:
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FrameNum IsADup Metric
    <p>Run Length is the number of duplicates (thus defined) in a row that
    defines a static scene subject to protection. A protected static scene is
    decimated by the ratio remove/cycle, no more and no less (subject to integer
    truncation).
</ul>

<h3>Avisynth Filter Parameters</h3>
Following is the syntax for MultiDecimate (replace <i>parameter_list</i> with
your comma-separated list of named parameters):
<p>MultiDecimate(<i>parameter_list</i>)
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><b><i>pass</i></b> (1 or 2, default 1): This parameter defines the processing
pass as described above.
<p><b><i>quality</i></b> (0-3, default 2) This option allows the user to trade
off quality of difference detection against speed. Following are the
possibilities:
<p>quality=0: Subsampled for speed and chroma not considered (fastest).<br>
quality=1: Subsampled for speed and chroma considered.<br>
quality=2: Fully sampled and chroma not considered.<br>
quality=3: Fully sampled and chroma considered (slowest).
<p><b><i>show</i></b> (true/false, default false) enables information to be
displayed on the frame. Also displays the software version.
<p><b><i>debug</i></b> (true/false, default false) enables information to be
printed via OutputDebugString(). A utility called DebugView is available for
catching these strings. The information displayed is the same as shown by the
show option above.
