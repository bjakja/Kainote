<h2>ShowFiveVersions</h2>
<p><code>ShowFiveVersions </code>(<var>clip1, clip2, clip3, clip4, clip5</var>)</p>
<p><code>ShowFiveVersions</code> takes five video streams and combines them
  in a staggered arrangement from left to right. The only use for this (that I
  can think of) is to help find the NTSC pulldown pattern. You can do this using
  code like this: </p>
<pre># View all five pulldown patterns at once
DoubleWeave()
# put a resizing filter here if necessary (see below)
a = Pulldown(0,2).Subtitle(&quot;0,2&quot;)
b = Pulldown(1,3).Subtitle(&quot;1,3&quot;)
c = Pulldown(2,4).Subtitle(&quot;2,4&quot;)
d = Pulldown(0,3).Subtitle(&quot;0,3&quot;)
e = Pulldown(1,4).Subtitle(&quot;1,4&quot;)
ShowFiveVersions(a,b,c,d,e)
</pre>
<p>This code displays the five pulldown patterns with some text identifying which
is which. I then look through the movie and pick the pattern which avoids blending
frames. (In ordinary pulldown, there will actually be two which work equally
well. Look at the diagrams in the <code><a href="pulldown.htm">Pulldown</a></code> filter section to see why.)
If none of the five works, then you're dealing with one of the more perverse
forms of pulldown and you might want to use <code><a href="peculiar.htm">PeculiarBlend</a></code>.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you're planning to capture at a high resolution and then scale
down, as I recommend elsewhere, you should probably place the <code><a href="reduceby2.htm">ReduceBy2</a></code>
or <code><a href="resize.htm">BilinearResize</a></code> or whatever just after the <code><a href="doubleweave.htm">DoubleWeave</a></code> statement
in the code above. Before <a href="doubleweave.htm"><code>DoubleWeave</code></a>
it won't work correctly, and
if you postpone it any further, <code>ShowFiveVersions</code> will produce a <u>really</u>
big frame.
