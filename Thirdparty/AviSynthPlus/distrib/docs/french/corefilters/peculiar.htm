<p><code>PeculiarBlend </code>(<var>clip, int cutoff</var>)</p>
<p>This filter blends each frame with the following frame in a peculiar way. The
portion of the frame below the <i>(cutoff)</i>th scanline is unchanged. The
portion above the <i>(cutoff-30)</i>th scanline is replaced with the corresponding
portion of the following frame. The 30 scan lines in between are blended incrementally
to disguise the switchover.
</p>
<p>You're probably wondering why anyone would use this filter. Well, it's like
this. Most videos which were originally shot on film use the 3:2 pulldown technique
which is described in the description of the <code><a href="pulldown.htm">Pulldown</a></code> filter. But some
use a much nastier system in which the crossover to the next frame occurs in
the middle of a field--in other words, individual fields look like one movie
frame on the top, and another on the bottom. This filter partially undoes this
peculiar effect. It should be used after th before the <code><a href="pulldown.htm">Pulldown</a></code>
filter.
To determine <i>cutoff</i>, examine a frame which is blended in this way and
set <i>cutoff</i> to the number of the first scanline in which you notice a
blend.

<p>This filter works only with YUY2 input.
