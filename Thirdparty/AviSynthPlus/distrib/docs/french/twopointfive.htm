<h2>
<a NAME="Gettingstarted"></a>AviSynth 2.5</h2>
<h4>New Video Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A new color format: native YV12 support. Supports YV12 planar input from
DirectShowSource, AviSource and several MPEG decoders.</li>

<br>For a description of the color formats AviSynth can deal with see <a href="corefilters/convert.htm" target="main">here</a>.</ul>
<h4>New Audio Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Internal float point samples support. AviSynth now has internal processing
of float samples.</li>

<li>
Native Int24 and Int32 sample support. Support input and output of higher
precision samples.</li>

<li>
Multiple channel support. AviSynth now supports an unlimited number of
channels for both input and output.</li>

<li>
Automatic sample conversion. If some filters doesn't support a specific
sample type, they are converted to the format preserving most quality (most
often floats). Float samples are also automatically converted back to 16bit
before delivering them as output.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Conditional Filters <strong>v2.52</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
It is now possible to change variables and filter parameter every frame
- very powerful and versatile function!</li>

<br>See <a href="corefilters/conditionalfilter.htm" target="main">ConditionalFilter</a>,
<a href="corefilters/conditionalreader.htm">ConditionalReader</a> and <a href="syntax.htm#RuntimeFunctions" target="main">here</a>.</ul>
<h4>New Internal Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Optimizations. Many basic features has been optimized, and now performs
much better than previous versions.</li>

<li>
Better cache efficiency. Filters can give hints to the cache, if they don't
want their input cached, so memory can be used more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h4>C-style plugin support <strong>v2.53</strong></h4>
<p>Added C-style plugin support (still in testing) to allow plugin writers to
  use other compilers than MSVC.<br>
  See <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=58840"><cite>this thread</cite></a>
  for further info. The C-plugins must be loaded with LoadCPlugin after loading
avisynth_c.dll. Your script becomes for example
<pre>LoadPlugin(&quot;...\avisynth_c.dll&quot;)
LoadCPlugin(&quot;...\smartdecimate.dll&quot;) # notice the C in loadCplugin
AviSource(...)
SmartDecimate()</pre>
<h4>DirectShow audio support <strong>v2.53</strong></h4>
<p>Using DirectShowSource it is possible to load audio from all sources that can
  be opened through DirectShow.<br>
  For example, formats like: WAV/DTS/AC3/MP3 can be opened. Look <a href="corefilters/directshowsource.htm">here</a>
  for more information.
<h4>Plugins</h4>
<p>Filters for AviSynth v1.0x and v2.0x do no longer work in v2.5x. When you try to load
them, they will
most likely even crash. You have to use a special plugin &quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-PaloAlto/2382/"><cite>LoadPluginEx.dll
(this plugin is contained in the WarpSharp package)</cite></a>&quot; to load v2.0x
plugins in v2.5x.<br>
You first have to load the v2.5x plugins, then LoadPluginEx.dll and finally the
v2.0x plugins. You will also need to copy <a href="../faq.htm#JapanesePlugin"><cite>msvcp71.dll
and msvcr71.dll</cite></a> to your system dir. Your script becomes for example
<pre>LoadPlugin(&quot;C:\Program Files\avisynth2_temp\LoadPluginEx.dll&quot;)
LoadPlugin(&quot;C:\Program Files\avisynth2_temp\plugins\dustv5.dll&quot;)

AviSource(&quot;D:\clip.avi&quot;)
ConvertToYUY2  # v2.0x plugins require YUY2 (or RGB)
PixieDust(5)</pre>
<p>I think that you can use the same plugin to load v2.5x plugins in v2.0x,
however I never have tested this.
