<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The syntax is given by</p>
<p><code>XSharpen</code> (<var>clip, strength = 128, threshold = 8</var>)</p>
<p>This filter performs a subtle but useful sharpening effect. It operates by running a small window over the frame and each center pixel is either passed through untouched (depending upon a
<var>threshold</var> setting), or mapped to either the brightest or dimmest pixel in the window, depending upon which is nearest to the center pixel.
If the center pixel is mapped, it is also alpha-blended with the original pixel value using a configurable
<var> strength</var> setting. The result is a sharpening effect that not only avoids amplifying noise, but also tends to reduce it. A welcome side effect is that files processed with this filter tend to compress to smaller files.</p>
<p>Description of parameters</p>
<p><var>strength</var><br>
When this value is 255, mapped pixels are not blended with the original pixel values, so a full-strength effect is obtained. As the value is reduced, each mapped pixel is blended with more of the original pixel. At a value of 0, the original pixels are passed through and there is no sharpening effect.</p>
<p><var>threshold</var><br>
This value determines how close a pixel must be to the brightest or dimmest pixel to be mapped. If a pixel is more than
<var>threshold</var> away from the brightest or dimmest pixel, it is not mapped. Thus, as the
<var>threshold</var> is reduced, pixels in the mid range start to be spared.</p>
<p>Description is taken from the <a href="http://neuron2.net/xsharp.html"><cite>equivalent
VDub filter of Donald A. Graft</cite></a>.</p>
