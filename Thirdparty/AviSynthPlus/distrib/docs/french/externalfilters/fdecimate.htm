<h3>Introduction</h3>
The FDecimate() filter provides extended decimation capabilities not
available from Decimate(). It can remove frames
from a clip to achieve the desired frame rate, while retaining audio/video synchronization.
It preferentially removes duplicate frames where possible. ("FDecimate" stands for "Free Decimate",
which implies that the output frame rate may be freely chosen, and is not limited to 1-in-N
decimation).
<p>
Increasingly we are seeing applications where
traditional 1-in-N decimation is not sufficient. Four of them in particular
stand out.
<p>
First, High Definition (HD) digital television often delivers a doubled frame rate, e.g.,
59.94 fps for ATSC. A progressive film with a native frame rate of 24 fps can be converted to
HD rates by duplicating frames in a pattern. For example to get from 24 fps to 60 fps, we
can use this pattern:
<p>
A A A B B C C C D D E E E F F ...
<p>
We can call this a 3232... frame duplication pattern. Another example is 25 fps to 60 fps
conversion, which uses a 3232232322... pattern. Converting from 60 fps to the broadcast rate
of 59.94 fps can
be achieved by either slowing down the video and adjusting the audio to match it, or by
excluding one of the duplicates every 1000 frames. In either case, our final stream has
many duplicates and the traditional 1-in-N decimation approach can no longer be directly
applied. Sometimes, successive 1-in-N decimations can be applied, but this is cumbersome.
And while Decimate(mode=2) is helpful with multiple duplicates, it is not always successful
in that regard.
<p>
Second, anime is often rendered at 12 fps and converted to 29.97 fps by duplicating frames in
a manner similar to that described above. The result is the same: a stream with multiple duplicates
that is not reliably addressed by 1-in-N decimation.
<p>
Third, many silent films are transferred to DVD by adding duplicates in
unusual patterns, because the original frame rates are not 24 fps. It is not
unusual to see clips requiring strange decimations such as 20 in 43. Sometimes
these strange decimations can be attained, or nearly attained, through
repeated application of Decimate() using different cycles, but that is a
cumbersome approach that cannot always attain the exact decimation ratios
required. FDecimate() allows specification of arbitrary frame rates and is therefore
useful in recovering the original cranking rates of these silent movies.
<p>
Fourth, sometimes clips
are rendered at 120 fps to properly present hybrids of film and video. if we wish to return to
normal frame rates, we need to remove multiple duplicates.
<p>
The FDecimate() filter helps in these situations. An earlier filter, MultiDecimate(), also attempted
to help but it is a two-pass implementation that requires an additional external program, and is therefore
cumbersome. It also could produce audio desynchronization if not used very carefully. I consider
FDecimate() to be a superior approach.
<p>
Please note that, while FDecimate() can be used for traditional 1-in-N decimation, it is probably preferable to stay with Decimate() for those applications, because it does not require the setting of a threshold for duplicate detection when used in mode=0.
<p>
This version supports YUY2 and YV12 for Avisynth 2.5.
<p>
If you are wondering how FDecimate() differs from the Avisynth internal filter ChangeFPS(), the answer is
that FDecimate() can preferentially deliver unique frames, avoiding duplicates where possible.

<h3>How to Use FDecimate()</h3>
To achieve good results, it is important to set the target frame rate correctly and to set the threshold
for duplicate detection correctly. Let's first consider the target frame rate.
<p>
<b><i>Determining the Target Frame Rate</i></b> If you just want to achieve a known target frame rate,
you can just go ahead and set the 'rate' parameter
to that rate.  For example, you may know that the source originated as 24 fps film.
But often we have a clip with an irregular pattern of duplicates and we do not know what the
target frame rate should be. This is often the case when processing old silent movies.
<p>
The proper frame rate can be determined using the following procedure. Find a section of the clip that is
about ten seconds long and contains constant motion. Step though the video without decimation and
record the pattern of duplicates. For example, I might see this:
<p><tt><pre>
new picture followed by a duplicate of it
new picture
new picture followed by a duplicate of it
new picture
new picture followed by a duplicate of it
new picture
...</pre></tt>
<p>
I could record this in shorthand as: 212121... Now we need to determine the ratio of the number of unique
pictures to the number of total frames. For a repeating 212121 pattern we would have a ratio of
2/3. You may not see a repeating pattern, but it doesn't matter. Just count the number of unique pictures
in the ten second period and divide it by the total number of frames in that period.
<p>
Next, we multiply the ratio determined above by the frame rate of the undecimated clip. This gives the
target frame rate to be used if all the duplicates are to be removed. You may obtain a strange frame rate
that is not a standard one. If your target display device is the computer monitor, you may choose
to use that strange rate, because the computer can display at that rate. But if your target display is
a TV, you'll want to round the rate to the nearest standard rate. See the next section, "Why FDecimate()
Cannot Be Perfect, and What We Can Do About It", for some further
suggestions about selecting the target frame rate.
<p>
<b><i>Determining the Threshold for Duplicate Detection</i></b> If your clip has no duplicates and you
simply want to decimate it to a slower frame rate, then this step does not apply and you can set the
'threshold' parameter to zero (threshold=0). If your clip has duplicates, you want to preferentially remove
them, and so FDecimate() needs a way to determine which are the duplicates.
<p>
The process is as follows. Apply the FDecimate() filter with metrics enabled:
<pre><tt>FDecimate(metrics=true)</tt></pre>
<p>
This will display the difference metric for each frame (decimation is not performed when metrics=true).
Inspect the metric for the duplicate frames. You need to find a number such that the metric for all the
duplicates is below it, while the metric for the new pictures is above it. That number is the
threshold that should be set for the 'threshold' parameter. It is usually about 1.0-2.5, but it may differ
depending upon how noisy your clip is. It's important to get a good value for this threshold, so do it
carefully, inspecting several sections of your clip.
<p>
<b><i>Producing the Decimated Output</i></b> Once the target frame rate and duplicate threshold have been
determined, it is easy to produce the final decimated output. Assuming our target frame rate is 20.8 fps,
and our duplicate threshold is 2.1, we would use this FDecimate() call:
<pre><tt>FDecimate(rate=20.8,threshold=2.1)</tt></pre>
<p><hr>
<h3>Why FDecimate() Cannot Be Perfect, and What We Can Do About It</h3>
You may find that FDecimate() does not operate perfectly on some of your clips. For example, it may skip a frame, or it may let through a duplicate frame. People sometimes suppose that things should be perfect, but
after thinking carefully about it, we can see that perfection isn't possible if we need to retain audio/video
sync.
<p>
The idea that the "perfectionists" propose is to simply discard all duplicate frames. This process is
successful, i.e., audio/video sync is retained, if the duplicate pattern is consistent. But if the pattern
is inconsistent, and often it is not, then sync is compromised. To see why, consider this duplicate
pattern (actually observed in an HD clip):
<p>
<tt>...3232323232321222212232323232...</tt>
<p>
Most of the time, the clip is 323232..., which implies a 24 fps rate for the clip with the duplicates removed
(the source frame rate is 59.94 fps). But in the middle of the pattern, the number of duplicates drops for
a while, which implies a faster base frame rate. If we just drop all duplicates and retain
the unique frames, we will be playing this middle section too slow at 24 fps. Be aware that the audio is synchronized to the pattern prior to decimation, so playing slow for a while will lead to audio/video desync. In fact, the pattern above will throw off the sync by about 200 milliseconds, which is massive. A few hits like this in a row can throw off the audio by handfuls of seconds!
<p>
(Another problem with the idea of just throwing out all duplicates is that clips often have static sections
where there is no motion. We don't want to throw them away! It's conceivable to detect them and try to
spare them but it is an additional complication. The serious problem is the synchronization issue described
above.)
<p>
Thus we can see that in the presence of variations of the underlying frame rate due to irregular patterns of
duplicates, we will destroy audio/video sync if we try to use the "perfect" approach. All we can
really do is to enforce the specified rate, while trying to prefer delivery of unique frames to
duplicates, where possible. FDecimate() uses this strategy.
<p>
If we have such a clip, in which there are random sections where the number of duplicates is reduced, we
may skip over good frames when we decimate. This causes perceivable jerks in the output. What can we do about this? We can take advantage of the fact that extra duplicates are less noticable than omitted frames.
If we set the target frame rate higher, we will retain more frames from the source, thereby reducing the
chances of skipping frames. Of course, this will retain more duplicates, too, but that is less objectionable.
For the example HD clip above, I was able to set a frame rate of 30 fps instead of 24 fps and thereby
achieve reasonable results, while still outputting a standard frame rate.
<p>For completeness I add this extra note. It is possible that the rate variations noted above could be
bipolar, i.e, some reduce the underlying rate and some increase it. Here is an example:
<p>
<tt>32323232222222323232323333333332323232323...</tt>
<p>
Theoretically we could try to decimate perfectly (as described above) and keep track of the resulting audio/video desync.
As long as the desync remained within acceptable limits, we could output "perfect" results. If the
desync moved outside the limits, we'd have to skip or duplicate a frame. The problem with this
approach is that in practice we never see such clips. What we see is clips with an underlying
base rate randomly punctured by an increase of that rate (i.e., short periods where there are not
as many duplicates as expected by the pattern).
<p>
I thus believe that there is no perfect solution for clips with random base rate variations.
However, I remain receptive to any new thinking that might improve things. Please feel free to
contact me if you have any ideas for improving FDecimate().

<h3>FDecimate() Parameters</h3>
Following is the syntax for FDecimate() (replace <i>parameter_list</i> with
your comma-separated list of named parameters):
<p>
<tt>FDecimate(<i>parameter_list</i>)</tt>
<p>
Here is an example:
<pre><tt>FDecimate(rate=23.976,threshold=0.8,show=true)</tt></pre>
<p><hr><p>
<b><i>rate</i></b> (float, default 23.976) This parameter sets the desired output frame rate. Frames will be removed from the video to achieve this frame rate while keeping audio and video in sync.
<p>
<b><i>threshold</i></b> (float, default 1.0) This parameter sets the threshold difference metric for
duplicate detection. If the difference metric between two frames exceeds this threshold, the two frames are
considered to be different frames. i.e., not duplicates. Refer to the "How to Use FDecimate()" section above
for an explanation of how to set this threshold properly.
<p>
<b><i>metrics</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter is used to determine the proper threshold
to use for duplicate detection. When it is set to true, no decimation occurs and the difference metric for each frame is shown overlaid on the video and in the DebugView output. Refer to the "How to Use FDecimate()"
section above for an explanation of how to use this parameter to set the threshold properly.
<P>
<b><i>show</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter enables information to be displayed on the frame. It also displays the software version.
<p>
<b><i>debug</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter
enables information to be printed via OutputDebugString(). A utility called DebugView is available for catching these strings. The information displayed is the same as shown by the show option above.
<p><hr>
<h3>Changing FDecimate() Parameter Defaults</h3>
<p>If
you do not like the defaults as documented above, you can set your own standard
defaults. To override the defaults, create a default file in the
Avisynth plugins directory. For
example, to set the default threshold=2.0 for FDecimate(), make a file called
FDecimate.def and put this line in it: </p>

<p>threshold=2.0 </p>

<p>You can list as many parameter assignments as you like, one per line. Those
not specified assume the default values documented above. Of course, you can
always override the defaults in your scripts when you invoke the functions.
NOTE: The lines in the defaults file must not contain any spaces or tabs. </p>
