Smart Decimate removes telecine by combining telecine fields and
decimating at the same time, which is different from the traditional
approach of matching telecine frames and then removing duplicates. The
latest version of Smart Decimate can be found at <a

<pre>LoadPlugin(&quot;...\avisynth_c.dll&quot;)
LoadCPlugin(&quot;...\SmartDecimate.dll&quot;)
AssumeTFF() # or AssumeBFF()

<p>
<b>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE FIELD ORDER IS CORRECT.</b>

<a name="guide"><h2>Guide to Usage</h2></a>

For this guide I will assume that your material is 3:2 pulldown with
some possible video mixed in. However, SmartDecimate can handle any
fixed decimation ratio.
<p>
To use this filter, you must first determine the correct field
order. If the field order is wrong, my filter will not work
correctly. To determine the field order:
<pre>AviSource(...)
AssumeTFF()
Bob()</pre>
Now preview the video and look for backwards motion. If you don't see
any, then you should use "assumetff()". If you do see any, try:
<pre>AviSource(...)
AssumeBFF()
Bob()</pre>
And once again look for backwards motion. If you don't see any this
time, then you should use "assumebff()".
<p>
Now its time to set up my filter:
<pre>LoadPlugin(&quot;...\avisynth_c.dll&quot;)
LoadCPlugin(&quot;...\smartdecimate.dll&quot;) # notice the C in loadCplugin
AviSource(...)
AssumeTFF() # or AssumeBFF() as determined above
SmartDecimate()</pre>
If you are happy with the result, then that is all that is needed. If
not, read on.
<p>
If your material is anime with lots of repeated frames, then you
should try:
<pre>SmartDecimate(tel=0.60)</pre>
This should avoid any bobbing on long sequences with no motion.
<p>
The "tel" value controls how aggressive the filter is when matching
fields.  The default value is 0.50.
<p>
If you have a mixed video with a large amount of true video, then you
might want to lower "tel" to as low as 0.25. This will risk bobbing
some progressive frames, but should not weave true video frames, which
may leave combing artifacts.
<p>
If you have a video that is pure 3:2 pulldown with very few true video
frames, then you might try raising "tel" to as high as 0.75. This will
cause SmartDecimate to be really aggressive when matching progressive
fields. However, it will likely end up leaving serious combing
artifacts behind if there is any pure video in your clip.
<p>
If you have a really noisy video, then you might need to raise the
noise factor such as:
<pre>SmartDecimate(noise=0.80)</pre>
The default value is 0.50. Leave it at the default unless your clip is very noisy.
Higher values of noise will often leave behind more combing artifacts for pure
video frames.
<p>
If you have a really clean clip and you notice some combing artifacts
in pure video frames, then you might want to lower the noise
factor. But be careful; if it is too low, SmartDecimate won't be able
to match the progressive fields and will thus bob them.
<p>
Finally, if you have a hybrid video (mixed 3:2 pulldown and true
video), you should consider replacing the dumb bob with something like
DgBob or SmoothDeinterlace.  To do this, use the "bob" option. For
example:
<pre>SmartDecimate(bob=DgBob(...))</pre>
This will greatly improve the quality of the pure video frames. Note
that the bob source only affects how bobbed frames are rendered. It is
not used to compare fields. Nor is it used by any other part of
SmartDecimate.

<a name="ref"><h2>Filter Reference</h2></a>

The filter will work with either YUY2 or YV12 input.
<p>
The usage is:
<p><code>SmartDecimate</code> (<var>[numr, denm], options</var>)</p>

The numerator and denominator are for the decimation ratio for the
video <b>after</b> it has been separated into fields. The
default is 24 and 60 for <var>numr</var> and <var>denm</var> respectfully.

<p>
The following options may be used to fine tune <code>SmartDecimate</code>:

<p>
<var>bob<br>
</var>an alternative source of bob deinterlaced frames. The default is &quot;<a href="../corefilters/bob.htm">Bob</a>()&quot; which is AviSynths built in dumb bob filter. For better results,
  use a smart bob such as <a href="dgbob.htm"> DgBob</a> or SmoothDeinterlace. The bobbed source
  is used whenever SmartDecimate determines that a field is not part
  of a progressive frame.
<p>
<var>weave<br>
</var>an alternate source of weaved frames. The default is &quot;<a href="../corefilters/doubleweave.htm">DoubleWeave</a>()&quot;.
<p>
<var>tel<br>
</var>a number between 0 and 1 which controls how aggressive the filter
  is when matching fields. 0.50 (the default) will work well with most
  clips. The higher the value, the more risk there is of leaving combing
  artifacts in true interlaced material. The lower the value the more
  risk there is to bobbing (or in the extreme case skipping or
  duplicating) Telecine frames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently <var>tel
</var> toggles various internal options depending on what
  it is set to.  Currently there are switches at: 0.45, 0.55, 0.65
  and 0.72.
<p>
<var>noise<br>
</var>The noise factor.  The default value, 0.50, should work in most
    cases.
<p><var>t_max<br>
</var>An alternate method of setting the noise factor.  You need to
  understand how my filter works in order to use it.</p>
<p><var>cpu<br>
</var>Force the CPU to a particular type.  It is normally auto detected.
  To see if it is detected correctly turn logging on.  The first line
  of the output will display the CPU type.  Current valid values for
  this value are: 0 - Generic, 2 - Integer SSE, 3 - SSE, 4 - SSE2.</p>
<p><var>unaligned<br>
</var>Allow reading of unaligned data. Normally <code>SmartDecimate</code> may ignore a few
  pixels at the beginning or end of each row, so that reads are aligned
  nicely. Setting this value to true will prevent this.</p>
<p>
The following options can be used to control the printing of useful information:
<p>
<var>log_level<br>
</var>The verbosity of the information printed. Default is 2.
<p>
<var>log_file<br>
</var>If set, all output will be appended to the filename specified.
<p>
<var>console<br>
</var>If set to true, then a console window will pop up and all output will be
  sent to it.
<p>
<var>debug_print<br>
</var>If set, then all output will be printed using the OutputDebugString system
  call. You can view this output with a utility such as DebugView.
<p>
The meaning of the information printed is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>"Reseting to NUM" means that the internal variables are reset and
any patterns are reset.  This will happen when ever the video
is accessed in a non-linear way.</li>
  <li>"FRAME 3 = [3, 4]"
indicates how frame number 3 (for example)
is being rendered.  Here 3 indicates the primary source field that is
chosen.  If the frame is to be rendered by weaving two fields together,
the numbers in [] indicate which source fields are chosen.  If the frame
is to be bob deinterlaced that the [] will instead be "BOB".</li>
  <li>"Diff NUM: WHAT DIFF"
indicates the difference between to source field
NUM and NUM+1.  WHAT is the classification of the difference with
0 meaning the same, 1 similar, and 2 different.  DIFF is the numerical
difference.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following options may be used to tune internal parameters. In
order to understand what they do, you will need to look at the
source. They may be changed between releases.
<ul>
  <li>max_last_set - positive integer
  <li>t1_def, t2_def, t1_max, t2_max - float between 0.0 and 1.0
  <li>floor - float between 0.0 and 1.0
  <li>floor_adj = float larger than 0.0
  <li>sml_peak, lrg_peak - float larger than 1.0
  <li>sml_tail_diff, lrg_tail_diff - float larger than 0.0
</ul>

<a name="works"><h2>Understanding how SmartDecimate Works</h2></a>

This discussion assumes that the reader is familiar with interlaced
video, and knows the meaning of such terms as frame, field, top field,
bottom field, BFF, TFF, telecide, telecine, 3:2 pulldown, etc..
<p>
Other telecide filters generally remove telecine in a two step
process. First telecine fields are matched up but the frame rate is
not changed, then duplicate frames are removed. SmartDecimate does not
work this way. SmartDecimate instead, combines telecine fields and
decimates the frame rate at the same time.
<p>
The very first thing SmartDecimate does is to use "SeparateFields()",
which will split the video into individual fields, which will also
double the frame rate. Therefore field number 9 really is the bottom
field of frame 4 (assume the video is TFF) before separating it into
fields. For simplicity, I will always refer to fields from the source
video in this way.
<p>
SmartDecimate then selects fields in a regular pattern, trying to
avoid selecting duplicate fields. More precisely, let N be the
destination frame number and R be the ratio which for 3:2 pulldown
will be 24/60 = 2/5, then SmartDecimate choses between field
floor(N/R) and floor(N/R) + 1. For example, for destination frame
number 5, using typical 3:2 pulldown, SmartDecimate will chose between
field 12 and 13. Which one it choses is rather complicated, and
something I will not get into here.
<p>
After a source field is chosen, it needs to decide how to render
it. SmartDecimate choses between: 1) matching it up with the previous
field, 2) matching it up with the next field, or 3) bob deinterlacing
it. Which one it choses is based on how similar the field is to the
previous or next field. If the field is the same as the previous or
next field it will match it up with that field by weaving the two
fields together. If it can't find a matching field, it will bob
deinterlace the current field. SmartDecimate doesn't actually do the
final rendering. Instead it uses anther AviSynth filter to do the work
for it. In the case of weaving it will use DoubleWeave(), and in the
case of bobbing it will use Bob() or a smart bob filter if one is
provided.

<a name="t_max"><h2>Tuning T_Max</h2></a>

In order to discover which fields are different from each other and
which are the same, SmartDecimate looks for peaks in the difference
string. That is given three values representing the difference between
four consecutive fields A B C D, if BC (ie the difference between B
and C) &gt; AB and BC &gt; CD and AB and CD are close in value than
the fields A and B are likely to be the same, fields B and C are
likely to be different, and fields C and D are likely to be the same.
<p>
However, this method is not perfect and can sometimes classify high
motion scenes when similar difference values between frames (that is
AB and CD are the similar) as being the same. So, to control this
SmartDecimate simply assumes all fields with a difference greater than
a fixed threshold can not possibly be the same. Unfortunately there is
no optimal value for this threshold so it is set at a reasonable value
which should do well on most clips that are not extremely
noisy. However, this value will generally let some different fields
through which will lead to combing artifacts. To avoid this, the
threshold, "t_max", should be set as low as possible.
<p>
To discover what the best value for "t_max" is for a particular clip
you will need to know what the differences between frames are.  The
easiest way to do this is to set the "log_file" option (with the log
level set at 2 or higher) and run SmartDecimate on a significant
portion of your clip.  Once that is done you should see something like
the following in the log file:
<pre>...
Diff 827: 0 6.11586e-008
FRAME 331 = [828,827]
Diff 828: 2 8.21554e-005
Diff 829: 0 3.69098e-008
Diff 830: 0 3.27322e-008
FRAME 332 = [830,831]
Diff 831: 2 0.000124936
Diff 832: 0 6.48069e-008
FRAME 333 = [832,833]
Diff 833: 2 0.000102379
Diff 834: 0 3.54472e-008
...</pre>
The lines you are interested in are the ones that begin with "Diff
...".  The first number after the Diff is the source field number.
The second number is the classification of the difference with 0
meaning the same, 1 similar, and 2 different.  The final number is the
actual difference.  What you are interested in is the difference of
frames classified as the same.  You want to set t_max to slightly
above the maximum value of all differences classified as the same.
For this clip 7.0e-8 may be a good value.  But since I only looked at
a small portion of the clip it may need to be higher as differences
can vary by a large amount.  It is best to look at the value for
several different areas of the clip to get a safe value.  Assuming
7.0e-8 is a good value I can use it as follows:
<pre>SmartDecimate(t_max=0.000000070)</pre>
I wrote 0.000000070 instead of 7.0e-8 because AviSynth does not seem
to support scientific notation. To be sure that you converted the
number correctly set the log level to 3 or higher and look for a line
like:
<pre>t1_max = 7.00000e-008  t2_max = 2.10000e-007  max_last_set = 13</pre>
The value you are interested in is t1_max which is is 7e-8.  Thus I
converted the number correctly.  The other values are for other
internal thresholds.
<p>
Once you think you've found a good value for t_max, rerun your clip
though SmartDecimate with a log level set at 3 or higher to make sure
that you did not set it too low. If you set it to low an excessive
number of frames will be bobbed and you will see messages such as:
<pre>2001: T1 Maxed Out at 2.00000e-008</pre>
These messages are normal for the true video parts of your clip but
should not be seen in the telecine parts of your clip. If you see
them, it means t_max is to small and needs to be raised. The exact
value can be discovered by looking at the differences for the
surrounding frames. For example:
<pre>...
Diff 1999: 2 3.08506e-008
Diff 2000: 1 4.03734e-008
Diff 2001: 2 8.89810e-006
Diff 2002: 1 2.93221e-008
...</pre>
indicates that t_max should be at least 4.04e-8, but 4.5e-8 would be a
safer value.
<p>
Finally, please note that "t_max" and "noise" both control the same
internal parameter which is "t1_max".  They just do it in a different
way.  "t_max" sets it directly while "noise" sets it indirectly based
on an exponential formula.  As as SmartDecimate 0.21 this formula is:
<pre>t1_max = exp(17.65*noise - 20.71)</pre>
But the exact parameters can change between any release.  The idea is
that a noise value of 0.50 (the default) should work well with most
clips while 0.80 can be used for really noisy clips, etc.

<a name="deinterlace"><h2>Using a Post Deinterlacer</h2></a>

Ideally, the fields rendered by SmartDecimate should not need to be
deinterlaced if the parameters are properly tuned. Realistically, a
post deinterlacer might be useful. However, since SmartDecimate works
on the field rather than the frame level there are some things you
should be aware of.
<p>
Most deinterlacers work by always choosing the top field (or perhaps
the bottom) as the dominate field and selectively throwing information
in the other field out and then interpolating or blending. For normal
30 fps (or 25 fps pal) this is the correct thing to do. However, for
the output of SmartDecimate, this is not correct because the dominant
field is not always the same. It will depend on which field
SmartDecimate originally chose from the source video, and can either
be the top or the bottom field. Thus, a traditional deinterlacer might
throw out the wrong field. This might not even be noticeable, but you
should be aware of it.
<p>
Authors of deinterlace filers can correct this problem by paying
attention to the parity of the frame. SmartDecimate will always report
the parity of the original field chosen as the parity of the final
rendered frame. If the parity is true, then the top field should be
chosen. If it is false, the bottom field.  I will also be willing to
pass hints on to the deinterlacer to indicate which fields are bobbed
if someone will tell me how.

<a name="motion"><h2>Dealing With Unwanted Motion</h2></a>

By using the <var>weave</var> option, you can use different clips for the input
and the output. This is useful for dealing with subtitles or other
motion that you do not want to be considered when matching frames. For
example, to crop off subtitles you might want to try.
<pre>b = Bob()
w = DoubleWeave()
CropBottom(64)
SmartDecimate(bob = b, weave = w)</pre>
Then, the output video will not be cropped, but the last 64 lines will
not be seen by SmartDecimate. If you use this method, then the bob
source must also be specified. If you don't specify a bob source, then
it will attempt to use the input clip for "Bob()". But the resulting
clip will not have the same dimensions as the weave source.

<a name="decomb"><h2>Smart Decimate vs Decomb</h2></a>

Before <a href="http://neuron2.net/decomb/decombnew.html"><cite>Decomb 5</cite></a>
by Donald Graft (aka Neuron2), traditional telecine filters (that work
by first matching telecine fields up and then decimating by removing
duplicate frames) had a tendency to duplicate frames. With Decomb 5
Donald seems to have that problem solved. Nevertheless, the
SmartDecimate approach does have a number of advantages over the
Decomb approach and vice versa. So neither approach is necessarily
better than the other. Which filter you use depends on the source
material and the target frame rate.
<p>
<h3>Clean 3:2 pulldown material</h3>

Both Smart Decimate and Decomb will work great.  Decomb may still
leave some duplicate frames for highly irregular 3:2 pulldown
material.  Smart Decimate on the other hand, by the nature of how it
works, will generally not, but it may end up bobbing some frames that
it shouldn't.  In my informal tests Smart Decimate is slightly faster
than Decomb when Decomb's post processing is turned off.  With post
processing Smart Decimate is a lot faster.
<p>
<h3>Hybrid 3:2 pulldown and interlaced video</h3>

If for whatever reason you wish to leave the video at 30fps, then use
Decomb.  Smart Decimate will be able to match telecine frames up when
going from 60 -&gt; 30fps but it will also duplicate frames. Decomb has a
special mode to deal with this by blurring frames together, which can
lead to smoother motion.
<p>
If your target frame rate is 24fps, then the choice is based on
personal taste, as both Smart Decimate and Decomb handle the situation
completely differently, and with very different results.
<p>
Smart Decimate will handle video by selecting frames from a bobbed
source (twice the frame rate) in a 3:2 pattern. That is, it goes from
60 -&gt; 24fps.  This leads to fairly smooth motion without having to
resort to blurring frames together. However, the video is still
slightly jerky. In my experience, the slight jerkiness is generally
not noticeable except when there is scrolling text. For example, when
decimating scrolling credits in this fashion, the results are
awful. Since bobbed frames are used, you will also have some bobbing
artifacts.  The results will not be very good unless a smart bob is
used.
<p>
Decomb, on the other hand, will try to decimate true video by going
from a deinterlaced 30 fps source to 24 fps. It does this in one of
two ways. The first thing it can do is to simply drop one in every 5
frames. This approach will lead to extremely jerky results. The other
thing it can do it is to blend frames together. This approach will
lead to smoother video than the Smart Decimate approach, but not
without undesirable artifacts. Moving areas of the image will
generally be blurry. With very high motion, double images can appear
which can make it hard for the eye to follow the motion. Blurring
frames together also negatively effects compression because it makes
following motion more difficult.
<p>
<h3>Hybrid with 30 fps progressive</h3>

If your video has a decent amount of true 30 fps progressive material
in it, then you're better off with Decomb. By the nature of how my
filter works, it will drop one frame in every 5 when converting it to
24 fps.
<p>
Decomb on the other hand sees interlaced video and 30 fps progressive
as the same thing and will thus be able to blur frames together for
smother motion.  If your clip is mostly video/30 fps progressive with
some 3:2 pulldown Decomb can also keep it at 30 fps and blend the
pulldown material for better results.
<p>
<h3>Strange Telecine Patterns</h3>

If your telecine pattern is not 3:2 pulldown (or simple 25 fps
progressive in the case of pal) and you want to attempt to restore it
to its original frame rate you should try both Smart Decimate or
Decomb and see which one works out better.  I have no experience in
this area, so I really don't know.
<p>
<a name="other"><h2>Other Things to Try with Smart Decimate</h2></a>
<p>
Here are some other things you might want to try with Smart Decimate
that can't be done using traditional telecine filters such as Decomb.

<h3>Better Bob of Telecine Material</h3>

If your material contains any telecine material and you want to bob
deinterlace it to get 60 fps than you should try:
<pre>SmartDecimate(1,1, tel=0.25, bob=DgBob(...))</pre>
which will lead to better results than using DgBob (or most other
smart bob filters) alone, since telecine frames are duplicated rather
than being bob deinterlaced.  This could make a major difference with
anime.
<p>
<h3>Dealing with Telecine with Blurred Frames</h3>

If you are dealing with a lot of blurred frames, here is something to
try. Use SmartDecimate(1,1) and then attempt to pick out the
non-blurred frames by only choosing frames that are duplicated at
least once. You might be able to do the latter step with Decimate()
from the Decomb package, or <a
href="http://neuron2.net/multidecimate/multidecimate.html">MultiDecimate</a>.
I have no idea how well this will work as I have never tried it but I
thought I would mention it in case someone is interested in pursuing
it.

<a name="caveats"><h2>Caveats</h2></a>

When MMX/SSE optimization is used SmartDecimate may ignore up to 6 (14
for SSE2) pixels in the beginning or end of each row so that memory
reads are aligned.  If this bothers you, then set "unaligned" to true,
which will force SmartDecimate to use the non-optimized code when
reading frame data.
<p>
SmartDecimate will warn about any pixels ignored if the logging level
is set at level 0 or higher.

<a name="compile"><h2>Compiling</h2></a>

To compile SmartDecimate you will need to install Gcc and Nasm, and
perhaps GNU Make. I used <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>
(2.0.0-3) with MSYS 1.09, Gcc 3.3.1, and <a
href="http://nasm.sourceforge.net/">Nasm</a> 0.98.37. Except for Nasm,
all of the required utilities can be found on the <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml">MinGW Download
page</a>. Other configurations should work, but you may need to edit
the Makefile. Once all the proper tools are installed and in the path,
simply type:
<pre>make</pre>
from the MSYS shell and that is all that should be required.
