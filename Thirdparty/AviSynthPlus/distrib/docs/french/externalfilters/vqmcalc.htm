<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The compare function of AviSynth,
calculates psnr from two clips. The following method (called VQM) should be a
better video quality metrics than psnr. It is based on the following report:
<p><a href="http://ise.stanford.edu/class/ee392j/projects/xiao_report.pdf" target="_blank"><cite>http://ise.stanford.edu/class/ee392...xiao_report.pdf</cite></a>
<p>It is not exactly the same as in the white-paper as some vital informations are
lacking like the matrix we need to use for spatial masking.<br>
In this filter, i use MPEG Matrix with hope it reflects a bit Human Visual
System.<br>
No temporal masking is implemented in this method.
<p>A few experiments were done with a little clip encoded with xvid at constant
quant2/quant4/quant6 and quant2 with VHQ1.
<p>Keep in mind these results may not reflect video quality
<p>Mean VQM:<br>
Quant2: 37.16<br>
Quant4: 52.58<br>
Quant6: 63.12<br>
Quant2+VHQ1: 37.74
<p>More points (may) means less quality. It seems to scale well with Quants but it
doesn't like VHQ.
<p>It will only work with YV12. And it seems to not works with B-Frames.<br>
The clip must be mod8. If not it may crash.<br>
Another bugs i've encountered are:
<ul>
  <li>May crash when the log already exist.
  </li>
  <li>May crash during the clip, try again until it works.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you're not afraid to test it.</p>
<p><b>an example:</b></p>
<pre>a = Avisource(&quot;J:\Video\Source.avs&quot;)
b = Avisource(&quot;J:\Video\Quant6.avi&quot;)
return VqmCalc(a,b,&quot;results.log&quot;)</pre>
<p>PS: I use fdct_mmx from xvid sources, so i guess i need to release it GPL, and
include GPL headers. I'm not sure if i can, because it's inspired from a white
paper. I'll be glad to receive any help on this subject.</p>
