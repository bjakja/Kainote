</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>
* The avisynth_c plugin entry point is now officially "avisynth_c_plugin_init@4"
  (don't include @4 anywhere the compiler does it for you), this is not actually a
  change due to a bug in avisynth_c.h, which incidently caused it to be this already.<br>

  DSS</a>: DirectShowSource("F:\Guides\Hybrid\vfr_startrek.mkv", fps=119.88, convertfps=true)
  turns vfr into cfr stream by duplicating frames.<br>
* Histrogram: in color_mode - YUY2: Invalid values (below 16 and above 235)
  will be colored brown/yellow-ish. Made those values more visible.<br>
* Evaluate: Now breaks outs and reports system exceptions instead of
  reporting the useless "Evaluate: Unrecognized exception!".<br>
* BlankClip() no longer gobbles any implicit last clip as the template clip.
  You have to explicitly declare you want a template clip i.e. BlankCLip(Last).
  "BlankClip()" now always returns the default blank clip.<br>

<h2>Changes from 2.53</h2>

<h3>
Additions</h3>

* Added ConditionalReader(). This enables users to load per frame settings into
variables accessible to conditional variables.<br>
* Added &quot;Hardlight&quot;, &quot;SoftLight&quot;, &quot;Difference&quot; and
&quot;Exclusion&quot; as Overlay blend modes.<br>
* Added mode=&quot;chroma&quot;, &quot;luma&quot;, &quot;lighten&quot;,
&quot;darken&quot; to Overlay.<br>
* Overlay() now accepts RGB24/32 output.<br>
* Added &quot;pc_range=true/false&quot; parameter to overlay(). This will make
all RGB&lt;-&gt;YUV conversions inside Overlay assume [0-&gt;255] YUV range, and
not CCIR 601 [16-&gt;235] range. Default is false.<br>
* Added RGB input conversion to overlay.<br>
* ShowAlpha now returns RGB, YUY2, or YV12 via the pixel_type argument. The
latter two can be used to layer an RGB clip with alpha transparency data onto a
YUV clip using the 3-argument form of Overlay().<br>
* Added Overlay() for doing advanced video overlays/layers.<br>
* Added SuperEQ(). SuperEQ is a very precise 16 band equalizer.<br>
* Added IsYUV(clip) to script (it was only present in the documentation). (Party
Time)<br>
* Added internal audiocache by [WarpEnterprises]. Added automatically by the
filters that need it.<br>
* Added fast=true/false mode to SSRC. This will use a faster mode for
resampling. Default is false.<br>
* Added Histogram(mode=&quot;stereo&quot;) shows a clasic stereo graph (I guess)
from the audio in the clip. Some may know these from recording studios. Quite
nice actually.<br>
* Added Histogram(mode=&quot;stereooverlay&quot;). Draws the stereograph on top
of the original image. YV12 only.<br>
* Added ChangeFPS(linear=true/false). This will make AviSynth request frames in
a linear fashion, when skipping frames. Default:true.<br>
* Added SSRC(int samplerate) SSRC resampling. Note that it only downsamples.
Audio is always converted to float.<br>
* Added Tone(float length, float frequency, int samplerate, int channels, string
type). This will generate sound.
<ul>
  <li>Length is in seconds. Type can be &quot;Silence&quot;, &quot;Sine&quot;
    (default), &quot;Noise&quot;, &quot;Square&quot;, &quot;Triangle&quot; or
    &quot;Sawtooth&quot;.
  <li>Defaults are Tone(10.0, 440, 48000, 2, &quot;sine&quot;).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Bugfixes</h3>

<p>* Fixed out-of-bounds read in Normalize.<br>
* Fixed compiler warnings in avisynth_c<br>
* Fixed very small sample corruption in SSRC.<br>
* Fixed audio corruption problem if audio with start &lt; 0 was requested.
(introduced in Dec. 30th binary).<br>
* Fixed very small sample corruption in SSRC.<br>
* Better seeking precision in audio in DirectShowSource.<br>
* Fixed crashes and Audio corruption in ConvertToMono().<br>

mode=&quot;color&quot;. For Histogram</p>

<h3>
Optimizations</h3>

* Optimization: MMX in Dissolve.
<h3>
Changes</h3>

* Added Kevin Atkinsons avisynth_c 0.20 (stdcall) API.<br>
* Updated installer. Removed the old one.<br>
* SSRC: &quot;fast&quot; is now true per default. This setting is recommended,
unless you are doing a big samplerate adjustment (not just 48000 -&gt; 44100).<br>
* Updated installer. (Thanks to V_ICE for inspiration).<br>
* Re-Added German documentation.<br>
* EMMS is now executed between all filters to avoid potential FPU-states to be
carried from one filter to the next.<br>
* Reimplemented SSRC. It is now capable of running multiple instances, it has
been better tested (occational strange sample should be eliminated). This
version support both upsampling and downsampling with very high precision.<br>
* If any filter should request audio that is out of bounds, if will no longer be
passed to the filter above, but the invalid parts will be filled with silence.<br>
* Documentation restructured and much has been updated.<br>
* Added C-versions of conditional planedifference filters, for non-ISSE machines
(not well tested though).

<h2>
Changes from 2.52</h2>

<h3>
Additions</h3>
* Added audio support to DirectShowSource.<br>
* Added seeking support to DirectShowSource.<br>
* Added .GRF file loading to load filter graphs from GraphEdit. Be sure there is
an open pin, to which AviSynth is able to connect, otherwise expect &quot;the
filter graph won't talk to me&quot;.<br>
* Added optional coring=true/false to Levels and Tweak. both true by default,
as previously.
<br>* German documentation.
<br>* Added DV type 1 video input, using AviSource(). Video only!
<br>* DirectShowSource() is now capable of properly opening audio with
more than 2 channels. Tested with AC3Filter.
<br>* DirectShowSource() now accepts and properly decodes float-precision
samples. Tested with AC3Filter.
<br>* Added checks for samplerate and framerate in Splice.
<br>* SwapUV(), UToY(), VToY() and YToUV() now also works in YUY2 mode.
<br>* Added C-style plugin support (still in testing) to allow plugin writers
to use other compilers than MSVC. See this thread for further info.
<br>* Added Invert(), ShowAlpha().
<br>* Added default parameters to ColorBars.
<br>* Extensive updates of German documentation.
<br>* DirectShowSource capable of opening audio only. WAV/AC3/MP3 can be
opened using DirectshowSource.
<br>* Added experimental "align=true/false" to crop - this will realign
frames if they aren't already. Alignement is 16 for SSE2 machines, 8 for
others.
<br>* Added "Overall PSNR for Compare()" - thanks to temporance.
<br>* ResampleAudio now accepts any number of channels.
<br>* Added "after_frame=true/false" option to FrameEvaluate. This determines
if the script should be evaluated before (default operation) or after the
frame has been fetched from the filters above.
<h3>
Bugfixes</h3>
* Fixed memory leak in Plugin name export.<br>
* Incorporated file lock fix in AviSource by WarpEnterprises.

a dB amplification indication.
<br>* Fixed minor issues in audio routines with very long samples.
<br>* Fixed wrong colors in ShowSMPTE YV12 mode.
<br>* Corrected several performance problems in Limiter, YUY2 mode (thanks
again ARDA!).

<br>* Conditional unroll of fetch/unpack loop in dynamic compiled resizer.
Now only unrolls if 1) Athlon 2) Source width &lt; 512.
<h3>
Changes</h3>
* Further clarification in Info() regarding field information.
<br>* Minor changes to Limiter code (block prefetch).
<br>* ApplyRange now accepts startframe = stopframe. This will only process
the specified frame.
<br>* ApplyRange now supports audio and processes it to the end of stopframe.
<br>* Updated avisynth_c API to v0.14.
<br>* Reenabled function name export for VDubMod syntax highlighting -
I'm not sure if it had much effect on stability.
<br>* Corrected ParseMultiplication so it parses from left to right.
<br>* The default luma range in Limiter is corrected to 16-235 (it was
16-236).
<br>* Temporarily disabled plugin function export for VDubMod. I'm suspecting
this of the "crash+disappear" of VdubMod.
<br>* Removed HSIAdjust().
<br>* Removed ffvfw from installation.
<br>* ShowSMPTE does no longer require fps parameter - only if the current
fps cannot be used.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Changes from 2.51 beta</h2>

<h3>
Additions</h3>
* Added light version of "ffvfw" to the installer. No "Cannot locate decompressor
(YV12)" messages.
<br>* Added ConditionalFilter, that returns one of two sources based on
an expression.
<br>* Added conditional filters:
<br>** AverageLuma(), AverageChromaU(), AverageChromaV() functions. ''Returns
a float from 0 to 255 based on the average pixel values of a plane.''
<br>** YDifferenceFromPrevious(), UDifferenceFromPrevious(), VDifferenceFromPrevious()
and YDifferenceToNext(), UDifferenceToNext(), VDifferenceToNext()'''.
<br>** LumaDifference(clip,clip), ChromaUDifference(clip,clip), ChromaUDifference(clip,clip).
''They return a float value between 0 and 255 of the absolute difference.''
<br>** RGBDifference(clip1,clip2), RGBDifferenceFromPrevious(clip), RGBDifferenceToNext(clip).
<br>** YPlaneMax(clip, float threshold), YPlaneMin(clip, float threshold),
YPlaneMedian(clip), YPlaneMinMaxDifference(clip, float threshold). ''Threshold
is a percentage, on how many percent of the pixels are allowed above or
below minimum. The threshold is optional and defaults to 0. There are similar
funtions for U and V.''
<br>* Added ScriptClip(clip, string function, [show=true/false]). This
will return the clip returned by the function evaluated on every frame.
<br>* Added FrameEvaluate(clip, script) - Similar to ScriptClip, except
the output of the filter is ignored. This can be used for assigning variables,
etc.
<br>* YV12 &lt;-> RGB conversions now use an intermediate YUY2 conversion
to achieve better chroma upsamplig. As a result of this ConvertToRGB now
also take an "interlaced=true/false" parameter.
<br>* Added ImageWriter.
<br>* Added "show" parameter to ConditionalFilter. This will overlay the
results on the screen.
<br>* Added dynamic compiled limiter.
<br>* Implemented Belgabors patch for exporting plugin functions.
<br>* Build date is now (semi)automatically updated in version.
<br>* Added script functions: IsYV12(clip), IsPlanar(clip), IsInterleaved(clip)
<br>* Loads of documentation updates.
<h3>
Bugfixes</h3>
* Fixed cache hints a bit up.
<br>* Hopefully fixed jumping frame bugs in temporalsoften.
<br>* Fixed crashed in temporalsoften on some setups.
<br>* Fixed I420 / YV12 mismatch in Interleave.
<br>* Fixed problems with implicit last giving problem with multiple filter
instances of ScriptClip/ConditionalFilter.
<br>* Many ImageReader/Writer fixes and updates.
<br>* Fixed bug when height > 512 in RGB -> YV12 conversion.
<br>* AviSynth now mimics VDubs way of handling dropped frames to avoid
problems with buggy codecs.
<br>* Trim now returns (x-1) frames as supposed.
<br>* Fixed stereo setting in BlankClip
<h3>
Optimizations</h3>
* Added MMX RGB24->YUY2 conversion.
<br>* Minor changes to existing RGB32 -> YUY2 MMX.
<br>* Minor speedup to ISSE limiter.
<br>* Added SoftWire dynamic compiled horizontal resizer. Approximately
10-15% faster - maybe even more on P4.
<h3>
Changes</h3>
* AviSynth will now attempt to deallocate framebuffers, if memory usage
is 25% above default values or SetMemoryMax().
<br>* Improved rounding precision in ISSE YV12 &lt;-> YUY2 conversions.
<br>* Improved chroma upsampling quality in planar YV12 -> YUY2.
<br>* Better chroma alignment on interlaced YUY2 ->YV12.
<br>* Slightly better precision in audio conversion.
<br>* ApplyRange now checks if size and colorspace are the same.
<br>* Fixed float point exceptions being thrown in some applications, based
on the CPU register settings. (Especially Delphi-based apps).
<h2>
Changes from 2.50 beta</h2>

<h3>
Additions</h3>
* Added start/end parameters to ImageWriter.
<br>* Added Chr, Time and Spline script functions.
<br>* Added ISSE and MMX YUY2->YV12 conversions. Faster than XviD - and
both interlaced and noninterlaced modes supported. Use ConvertToYV12(interlaced=true).
<br>* Added rewritten YV12->YUY2 (progressive) conversion to avoid using
buggy XviD conversion. It also has better quality as it properly interpolates
chromas as opposed to simply copying it. Speed should be the same. Use
ConvertToYUY2(interlaced=true).
<br>* Added TurnLeft /TurnRight.
<br>* YToUV() now takes an optional third parameter, that contains luma
for the final clip.
<br>* AudioLength() now returns the size in samples (do however beware
of overflows on very long clips)
<br>* Added ApplyRange.
<h3>
Bugfixes</h3>
* Fixed Splice problems with YV12 from different sources. Audio is now
automatically converted to the same format.
<br>* Fixed bug in YV12 stackvertical, causing corrupt images.
<br>* Fixed memory exception problem in Blur.
<br>* Fixed non-matching image type in Stack.
<br>* Fixed rounding in Temporalsoften mode 2.
<br>* Fixed crashbug in YUY2 mergechroma.
<br>* Fix bug in C version of YUY2->RGB24.
<br>* Fixed bug with uninitialized data in AviSource.
<br>* Fixed wrong pitch being used in Temporalsoften scenechange - could
in rare cases lead to unexpected results.
<br>* Fixed rounding in some cases in Temporalsoften.
<br>* Doesn't add audio to track, if there is no present in AssumeSampleRate().
<br>* Fixed isBFF() and isTFF().
<h3>
Optimizations</h3>
* Put in Steady's new BitBlt code, and enabled it for ISSE capable processors.
<br>* Much "conservative" code removed. A general speedup should be expected.
<br>* Made SwapUV faster.
<h3>
Changes</h3>
* Removed all fieldbased/mod 4 checks.
<br>* Restored how fieldbased/framebased works.
<br>* Removed startup Box from installer.
<br>* Greyscale inserts value 128, instead of 127. Some users have reported
a greenish tint.
<br>* Updated AssumeTFF and BFF to also write the information to VideoInfo.
<br>* Updated icons.
<br>* BMP support (output only) in ImageWriter.

<br>- Changed maximum number of arguments from 40 to 1024.
<br>- Resampleaudio() caused crashes, if no audio was present.
<br>- Fixed: Exist() didn't work.
<h4>
Changes from 2.06</h4>
- Script extensions:
<br><tt>- - LeftStr(string, int size), RightStr(string, int size), MidStr(string,
int first, int length), FindStr(string, string), RevStr(string), StrLen(string)</tt>
<br><tt>- - Sign(int), sign(float), Nop, Rand([int limit]), Select(index,
item0 [,item1...]), Exist(string filename)</tt>
<br><tt>- - VersionNumber(), VersionString()</tt>
<br><tt>- - IsRGB24(clip), IsRGB32(clip), Int(float), Frac(float), Float(int),
Value(string), HexValue(string).</tt>
<br>- Strings can be compared using "&lt;" ,">","&lt;=",">=" operators
(case insensitive).
<br>- Color option for Fades , Letterbox, and Addborders.
<br>- Subtitle alignment and spacing options, added y=-1 centering support
(x=-1 undocumented support remains) and defaults for x,y and align vary
depending on each other's settings.
<br>- Optimization for recent BlankClip() RGB24 bug fix.
<br>- Fixed ceil, floor and round functions.
<br>- Fixed BlankClip RGB24 with odd widths.
<br>- Fixed DB scale off by 2x in volume.
<br>- Added FadeIn / FadeIn2 to fade in
video and audio.
<br>- Added AssumeSampleRate to
change the samplerate without resampling (yes, this will lead to desync!).
<br>- Fixed one frame wrong offset in trim, when second argument is negative.
<br>- Added abs(integer) and abs(float).
<br>- Fixed '%' (mod) in scripts, so it returns absolute values.
<br>- Added a boolean to DirectShowSource, so seeking can be manually disabled,
if it works very slowly.
<br>- Added PointResize() function.
Resamples as "Nearest Neighbour" in Virtual Dub.
<br>- Added SetWorkingDir() function.
<br>- Fixed Normalize crashes.
<br>- Added German documentation.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Changes from 2.05</h4>
- Fixed potential crashbug in Resize - real fix instead of previous hack.
<br>- Default alignment is now 16 bytes, which should be faster on P4.
<br>- Fixed bug in RGB32 greyscale,
when with not divideable with 2.
<br>- Added example scripts. - Added installer/uninstaller. No more need
to fiddle with .reg files and regedit.
<br>- Fixed Trim, so negative values works
as documented.
<br>- Fixes to plugin autoloading: - freezed when invalid dll encountered,
was locking files unnecessarily, now also loads avisynth plugins with VDF
extension.
<br>- Made forward seeking fallback code in DirectShowSource
files - it will not freeze anymore, just be very slow, since it has to
decode all inbetween frames!
<br>- Added LanczosResize which
uses the Lanczos3 algorithm - it provides better quality than BicubicResize
in many cases.
<br>- Better rounding precision in BicubicResize/BilinearResize.
<br>- Optimizations to YUY2 BicubicResize/BilinearResize.
<br>- New ResetMask() filter: sets the
mask to "all-opaque" (RGB32 only).
<br>- ChangeFPS() now changes the framecount
(thanks to Xesdeeni).
<br>- AVI files, that contains an invalid first frame are now rejected
- there is no way of handling this situation gracefully. Segmented AVI's
automatically skip these segments, and will NOT return an error.
<br>- Better parameter checks on Crop()
and LetterBox().
<br>- Fixed wrap at right side of picture in RGB BicubicResize()/BilinearResize().
<br>- Fixed another Chroma wrap issue in BicubicResize()
<br>- Added optional pixel_type parameter to AVISource
and siblings to force a decompression format (YUY2, RGB32 or RGB24).
<br>- Added optional left and right parameters to Letterbox
- parameters are placed after the existing to preserve compatibility.
<br>- Added EnsureVBRMP3Sync(clip),
to avoid desync of VBR-compressed mp3-soundtrack. This will slow seeking
down considerably, but is very useful when using
trim() for instance. Always use before trim().
<br>- BugFix: Fixed crashbug in Resize functions on some machines.
<br>- AviSource always returns last
valid frame on decompression errors.
<br>- Added check for invalid frame 0 (mostly seen in SegmentedAviSource()).
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>

<br>- Reorder function loading to hopefully give plugins precedence over
filters
<br>- Added LowPassAudio(frequency) and HighPassAudio(frequency)
<br>- Many updates and additions to documentation.
<br>- New function: String(value) - converts any AVSValue to string.
<br>- Bumped number of plugins to 50 from 30
<br>- Avisynth now allocates minimum 16MB cache, or otherwise 1/4th of
free physical memory.
<br>- Plugin autoloading (Create
string regkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Avisynth\PluginDir) (still in
alpha)
<br>- Crash-on-exit bugfix in SegmentedAviSource.
<br>- Audio-related bugfix in AVISource.
<br>- Bugfix in FilteredResizeH (see bug [ 588402 ]) minor optimizations

<br>- Bugfix: dropped frame (introduced in 2.04).
<br>- Fixed bug in Pow(x,y)
<h4>
Changes from 2.03</h4>

Boolean parameter after clip turns it off.
<br>- Compile fix in temporalsoften.
<h4>
Changes from 2.02</h4>
- Fixed EMMS bug in ColorKeyMask
<br>- Fixed YUY2 detection issues in Layer
<br>- Added friendly error message for Layer ops
<br>- GetLeftChannel - Returns left channel.
<br>- GetRightChannel - Returns right channel.
<br>- MonoToStereo(clip1_left,clip2_right) - muxes two clips together as
one stereo clip.
<br>- MixAudio(clip_1,clip_2,float clip1_volume, float clip2_volume) Mixes
two audio sources together.
<br>- Added ConvertBackToYUY2() That only uses chroma from the left pixel
to avoid shifting chroma color by multiple YUY2->RGB>YUY2 conversions.
ConvertToYUY2 remains unchanged.
<br>- Added Documentation for new parameters
<br>- Added sound to Loop() function.
<br>- New function ConvertToMono(clip) - convert stereo to mono.
<br>- New function KillAudio(clip) removes audio from clip. Use this if
you get crashes with compressed AVI sound.
<br>- new filter: ColorKeyMask + bugfix in Layer
<br>- New function Normalize(clip, float max_left, float max_right). Normalizes
audio. Both floats are optional. If maximum values (0 to 1) are used, the
stream will peak at this level, otherwise the peak will at full volume.
<br>- TemporalSoften (MMX &amp; C ) (previously released as plugin TemporalSoften2)
<br>- MMX optimized HorizontalReduceBy2() in YUY2 mode.
<br>- Corrected one pixel offset bug in VerticalReduceby2().
<br>- MMX is now pixelperfect in compare with C implementations.
<br>- Changed order in ReduceBy2() since VerticalReduceBy2 is faster.
<br>- VerticalReduceBy2() has been MMX optimized. More than twice as fast.
Filter checks if image is too small to be reduced.
<br>- Colorbars() now also generates a test tone. Test tone is a 440Hz
sine at 48KHz, 16 bit, stereo. The tone pulses in the RIGHT speaker, being
turned on and off once every second.
<br>- ResampleAudio() now skips conversion, if samplerate is already at
the given rate.
<br>- No athlon codes in merge.
<br>- Converttoyuy2 MMX optimized.
<br>- Fixes in greyscale() in RGB mode.
<br>- Optimized layer() and decomb-filters.
<br>- Compare(clip filtered, clip original, string channels="", string
logfile="", bool show_graph=true)
<br>- AssumeTFF() and AssumeBFF() to force parity
<br>- Documentation restructured and updated.
