<h2>
AviSynth 2.56</h2>
<h3>Summary of changelist (with respect to v2.55)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added options to DirectShowSource (seekzero, timeout and pixel_type).</li>
  <li>Added DevIL support for RGB32 to ImageSource.</li>
  <li>Added Russian language documentation. Thanks to Fizick and his team. Well done.</li>
  <li>Added Merge() filter. Includes very fast iSSE pavgb code for weight=0.5.</li>
  <li>Added MergeARGB(), MergeRGB() filter.</li>
  <li>Added ShowRed(), ShowGreen(), ShowBlue() filters.</li>
  <li>Added operator MulDiv(multiplicand, multiplier, divisor).</li>
  <li>Added AssumeScaledFPS(multiplier, divisor, sync_audio) maps vi.MulDivFPS?.</li>
  <li>Added gamma option (ala ColorYUV) in RGBAdjust.</li>
  <li>Added Spline16Resize, Spline36Resize, GaussResize and LanczosResize(tap=xx)</li>
  <li>Added options to ShowFrameNumber: ShowFrameNumber(offset=10, x=360, y=576, font="georgia", size=24, text_color=$ff0000)</li>
  <li>Added integer offset to ShowSMPTE: ShowSMPTE(offset_f=10)</li>
  <li>Added options to ShowSMPTE: ShowSMPTE(offset="00:00:00:30", x=360, y=576, font="georgia", size=24, text_color=$ff0000)</li>
  <li>Added Fractional resampling support in ResampleAudio().</li>
  <li>Added Limiter(show=show_luma/show_luma_grey/show_chroma/show_chroma_grey) shows out of bound luma/chroma; *_grey makes the rest of the pixels greyscale.</li>
  <li>Added offsets and analyze option (ala ColorYUV) in RGBAdjust.</li>
  <li>ConvertTo*(Matrix="Rec709, PC.709, PC.601") conversions supported.</li>
  <li>ConvertFPS()/ChangeFPS() copies FPS from a 2nd clip.</li>
  <li>GreyScale() RGB supports Matrix="Rec709, Average"</li>
  <li>Support for [vfr content in DSS]: DirectShowSource("F:\Guides\Hybrid\vfr_startrek.mkv", fps=119.88, convertfps=true) turns vfr into cfr stream by
    duplicating frames (patch by Nyaochi).</li>
  <li>A lot of bugfixes and optimizations.</li>
  <li>Cache improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete list can be found <a href="http://www.avisynth.org/ChangeList">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Known problems and issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The seh/c++ exception handling mix in readhelper that will cause a crash in xp sp2.</li>
  <li>Some problems encoding .avs video with Windows Media Encoder 9. The problem is that the "wmeenc.exe" process doesn't shut down properly. The
    encoder program closes, but an instance of "wmeenc.exe" remains in Task Manager hogging a LOT of memory.</li>
  <li>Rightclick on scripts to open them in VDubMod: When the script is messed up in the script editor, the correct
    error message doesn't appear.</li>
  <li>The filter Animate:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <pre># script1
Version()
Animate(0,149,&quot;Crop&quot;,0,0,64,32, 316,0,64,32)

# script2
Version()
last.Animate(0,149,&quot;Crop&quot;, 0,0,64,32, 316,0,64,32)</pre>
  <p>Yes, these do work, but the original intention was that they do not. The way the code works is that it does env->Invoke() for each frame as it is rendered and evaluates "Last" at that time. Remember "Last" is just a variable that the parser keeps setting as the script is parsed, it is not updated at runtime. So it might be possible for wrong results to be
  generated. This issue should be looked at.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Possible other bugs which are reported <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=482673&amp;group_id=57023&amp;func=browse">sourceforge</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Future plans</h3>
<h4>AviSynth v2.57:</h4>
<p>This version will be a bug fix release (bugs which are found in v2.56).</p>
<h4>AviSynth v2.6:</h4>
<p>This version will be the next version. Plugins for v2.5 will work in v2.6.
Design goals and proposals can be found <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=98585">here</a>.
Proposals include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Y8 (greyscale), YV16 (4:2:2 planar), YV24 (4:4:4 planar) formats.</li>
  <li>All planes delivered to filters are 16 byte adress aligned and have mod 16 pitch.</li>
  <li>Thread-safe avisynth.h.</li>
  <li>Add MaskTools to the core.</li>
  <li>Official Win64 support.</li>
  <li>Intelligent frame prefetching on multicpu/core.</li>
  <li>ImageMagick support to import and export pictures (besides DevIL).</li>
</ul>
<h4>AviSynth v3:</h4>
<p>AviSynth v3.0 is a powerful frameserver for Windows and Linux, and it is a complete rewrite of AviSynth v2.5, written from scratch by Bidoche (David Pierre), Kurosu, Caro and others.
v3.0 is not relying on vfw anymore, although it can be used when possible. It is made in such a way, that new APIs can be added to the core, like ffmpeg and gstreamer.
Also here many new colorformats will be added: YV24, RGB45 and YV45 which are 15 bits depth versions of RGB24 and YV24.
Direct streaming will be supported, and many other new things. The progress can
be found <a href="http://www.avisynth.org/AviSynth30">here</a>. The discussion
takes place at irc.freenode.org#avisynth and <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=721468">here</a>.</p>
