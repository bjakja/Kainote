                    Japanese translations of AviSynth documentations

 Description:

  I made a Japanese translation team.
  We are trying to translate AviSynth documentations to Japanese.
  But it will take a lot of time to complete translation.
  So, we decided to release the pages we already finished translating.

  Now it includes not so many pages.
  But we will continue to tranalate, add new pages and release it once a month or once in two months.
